2. What is an In-Home Health Evaluation (IHE)?
An In-Home Health Evaluation is a one-on-one assessment where a licensed clinician visits a member at their home. The clinician reviews the member's medical history, checks vital signs, and may conduct tests for chronic conditions. The goal is to offer personalized health insights, identify potential health risks, and connect members to additional healthcare resources.

3. Will I be charged for the health evaluation?
No, there is no cost to members for the in-home or virtual health evaluations provided by Signify Health. The service is part of your health plan's benefits, and there are no out-of-pocket expenses for the visit.

4. How do I schedule or reschedule my visit?
You can easily schedule or reschedule your In-Home Health Evaluation by calling the Signify Health customer service line or visiting their scheduling portal online. Flexible appointment options are available, including weekends and evenings, to accommodate your schedule.

    Review your medical history.
    Conduct a physical exam and check your vitals.
    Answer any health-related questions you may have.
    Provide recommendations based on your current health status. The visit typically lasts around 45 to 60 minutes, and the results are shared with your primary care provider to ensure a coordinated approach to your care.
6. How long does an evaluation take?
In-home evaluations usually take between 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity of your health conditions and any specific tests that may be conducted during the visit.

8. Do I need to prepare for my In-Home Health Evaluation?
To prepare for your evaluation, have your current medications and medical history available for the clinician. It is also helpful to write down any questions or concerns you may have about your health so the clinician can address them during the visit.

9. Who will be conducting the evaluation?
Your evaluation will be conducted by a licensed clinician, which could be a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. All clinicians are highly trained and certified to perform comprehensive health evaluations.

10. What happens after my evaluation?
After your evaluation, the clinician will send a detailed report to your primary care provider. This report will outline the findings from your evaluation and offer recommendations for any further care or testing that may be needed. You may also receive a follow-up from Signify Health if any immediate action is required.
