        - Who will be conducting the evaluation? Your evaluation will be conducted by a licensed clinician, which could be a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. All clinicians are highly trained and certified to perform comprehensive health evaluations.
        - What happens after my evaluation? After your evaluation, the clinician will send a detailed report to your primary care provider.
